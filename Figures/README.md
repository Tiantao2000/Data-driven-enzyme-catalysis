Figure 2 Three hierarchical levels in modeling enzyme catalysis. (a) Reaction-level modeling: components in a reaction (left), prediction of forward synthesis and retrosynthesis (center), and annotation of reactions (right). (b) Pathway-level modeling: components of a pathway (left), reaction integration, de novo expansion (center), and evaluation (right). (c) Enzyme-level modeling: function annotation (left), mutant-based optimization (center), and de novo design (right).

Figure 7 Approaches for de novo Enzyme Design. (a) Blueprint approach is based on a predefined fold topology and is refined through syntactic planning. (b) Protein hallucination approach employs MCMC optimization and neural network evaluation to iteratively optimize the sequence to reach a stable structure. (c) Generative approach generates structures from initial random noise and reconstructs them by diffusion models.
